### Time and location
At 15:00 Europe/Paris time in the `#diversity-meetings` channel on the [Symfony Slack][slack].

### Agenda
1) SymfonyCon social will likely not have enough seats for everyone, so we also need entertainment while standing
2) there are 2 SymfonyCon slots available (one keynote) that could go to marginalized speakers
